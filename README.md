EECS 249 - Embedded Systems Project

This codebase is for the 249 project, in which build a robotic waiter system that serves drinks in a restaruant or dining venue.

The system utilizes computer vision systems to determine location of robots and dining locations. Motion control algorithms provides point to point location movement control

Obstacle avoidance and path navigation is also coordinated by the main system and aided by ultrasonic sensors.

The whole system communicates through multiple bluetooth channels
